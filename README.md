### Purpose
This repo is an answer to Samer Buna's [challenge](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/before-you-bury-yourself-in-packages-learn-the-node-js-runtime-itself-f9031fbd8b69). In that article, he challenges a reader's knowledge of Node and prompts the reader to level up. The prompt worked on me.

He writes great content and knows his stuff. I actually read his challenge article after reading his [excellen article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/requiring-modules-in-node-js-everything-you-need-to-know-e7fbd119be8) on Node modules. After reading that article, I realized that being able to answer the questions in his challenge will deepen my knowledge of Node and help with understanding any Node code I come across.

This repo will be an answer to Samer's article and a reference for myself on the little things that make Node a great tool.
